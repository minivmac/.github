# Mini vMac

This repository will serve as a starting point for coordinating the further development of the Mini vMac 68k Macintosh Emulator, **in case that the main development page ceases to exist for whatever reason**

If you want to work on some features (or already have), please feel free to make a push request. If you want to join this organization for helping out with further development in general, please also feel free to drop us a line!
